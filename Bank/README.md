## This Go program implements a simple Bank Application

This application allows users to:

* Deposit funds
* Withdraw funds
* Check their balance
* Exit the application

**Key functionalities:**

* **Account Balance Persistence:** The application reads and writes the account balance to a file (`balance.txt`) for persistence across program runs.
* **Error Handling:** Basic error handling is implemented to catch potential issues during file operations.
* **User Interaction:** A menu-driven interface allows users to easily interact with the application.

**Learning points:**

This program demonstrates various Go concepts like:

* Packages (using `fmt`, `os`, `strconv`)
* Variables (account balance, user choice, etc.)
* Functions (deposit, withdraw, check balance
* Control Flow (loops and switch statements)
* File I/O (reading and writing data)
* Formatting 

**Running the Application:**

1. Save the code as `bank_app.go`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the program using the command: `go run bank_app.go`
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the bank application.
